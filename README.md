**Project Overview**
The Student Help System (SHS) is a robust application designed to provide role-based access and a secure, user-friendly platform for managing and accessing help articles. It caters to three primary user roles: Admins, Instructors, and Students, offering specialized tools and features for each role. The system's goal is to enhance learning and support by streamlining the organization and accessibility of educational resources.

This project was developed as part of CSE 360 coursework and progressed through multiple phases, with Phase 4 focusing on refining functionality, improving the user interface, and addressing feedback from earlier phases.

**Key Features**
Admin Role
1. Manage user accounts (create, delete, reset passwords).
2. Assign and modify user roles and permissions.
3. Backup and restore help articles and user data.
4. Oversee group management for regular and special access groups.

Instructor Role
1. Create, update, and manage help articles and groups.
2. Track student activity and support student learning.
3. Utilize enhanced search filters for content organization.
4. Perform role-based backups and restore operations.

Student Role
1. Search for articles with advanced filtering (e.g., by title, keywords, or group).
2. Access encrypted content with proper permissions.
3. Provide feedback and request help for unresolved issues.
4. View detailed help articles tailored to their level of access.

**Technical Details**
Architecture:
The SHS is built with a refined architecture to support secure and scalable operations:
1. JavaFX-based User Interface: Provides seamless navigation and user interactions.
2. Core System Components: Include a search engine, authentication services, content and group management, and backup systems.
3. Security Features: Enforces encryption for sensitive content and ensures strict access control.

**Development Highlights**
1. Comprehensive UML diagrams for architecture, use cases, and class design.
2. Implementation of robust security protocols for encrypted content management.
3. Automated and user testing to ensure reliability and usability.
4. Screencasts demonstrating system functionality and ease of use.
